        Policy.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Our Returns Policy forms a part of these Terms and Conditions. Please read our Returns Policy to learn more
        about your
        right to cancel Your Order.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Your right to cancel an Order only applies to Goods that are returned in the same condition as You received
        them. You
        should also include all of the products instructions, documents and wrappings. Goods that are damaged or not in
        the same
        condition as You received them or which are worn simply beyond opening the original packaging will not be
        refunded. You
        should therefore take reasonable care of the purchased Goods while they are in Your possession.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        We will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which We receive the returned Goods. We will use the
        same
        means of payment as You used for the Order, and You will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        You will not have any right to cancel an Order for the supply of any of the following Goods:
        &lt;ul class&#x3D;&quot;points&quot;&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate
                        rapidly or where the
                        date of expiry is over.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons
                        and were unsealed
                        after delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with
                        other items.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has
                        begun with Your prior
                        express consent and You have acknowledged Your loss of cancellation right.&lt;/li&gt;

        Service may be mispriced,
        described inaccurately, or unavailable, and We may experience delays in updating information regarding our Goods

        We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product

        The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence
        affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties, increased shipping charges, higher
        foreign
        exchange costs and any other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You will have the right to
        cancel
        Your Order.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class&#x3D;&#x27;subHeadder&#x27;&gt;PAYMENTS&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class&#x3D;&#x27;contentText&#x27;&gt;All Goods purchased are subject to a one-time payment. Payment can be made through various
        payment methods we have
        available, such as Visa, MasterCard, Affinity Card, American Express cards or online payment methods (PayPal,
        for
        example).
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by Your card
        issuer. If
        we do not receive the required authorization, We will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of Your Order.

        Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class&#x3D;&#x27;mainHeadder&#x27;&gt;Limitation of Liability
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class&#x3D;&#x27;contentText&#x27;&gt;Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any
        of its suppliers under any
        provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount
        actually paid
        by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven&#x27;t purchased anything through the Service.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for
        any
        special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for
        loss of
        profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy
        arising out
        of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party
        hardware
        used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any
        supplier
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
        consequential
        damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party&#x27;s liability
        will be
        limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class&#x3D;&#x27;mainHeadder&#x27;&gt;&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class&#x3D;&#x27;contentText&#x27;&gt;The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects

        or
        warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
        information,
        content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;
        (iii) as

        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
        statutory

        case
        the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable
        under
        applicable law.
